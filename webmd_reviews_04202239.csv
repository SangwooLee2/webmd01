I was given this BP med as a booster to the other 2 BP meds I take. On the other two I would have BP flare ups a lot up into the 140's/90's and on a bad flare up it would go up to high 150's/90's. Would feel terrible. My Dr thought I needed a little help. I didn't want to take a 3rd BP med but boy what a difference! I immediately noticed a difference and my BP stabilized down into the low 120's/80's and sometimes even under 120. Rarely anymore flare ups and if so would only go up into mid 130's/80's. Monthly checkups with my Dr also confirmed this & she was happy. But after 3 weeks I started noticing a dry cough from time to time. It was more of a throat tickle/scratchy throat feeling at the base of my throat that came out of the blue & would cause me to cough & once I started I couldn't stop for several minutes. Cough so hard I almost throw up sometimes. This would come & go. Some days I'm just fine. Told my Dr about it and she said she could switch me to another med in the same family that doesn't cause coughing. Tried to stay on it but now, after 5 months, the coughing fits have worsened and I can cough so hard I pee my pants! Funny but not funny. My son threatens to hide my med and both he & my husband want me to switch. Finally can't take it anymore so I have contacted my Dr and am having her switch me to other med. That one is Losartan so we'll see how I do. If you're coughing - it doesn't get better or go away - so switch your med if you can't tolerate it anymore. No way to live daily.

I am wondering how many who wrote of feeling tired and low energy are overweight and do not do enough exercise-walking 3x week (I know, I just don't always do.). However, I have felt weak and lightheaded, but I wonder if it was caused by my eating foods that had sodium in it (visiting family & friends, eating what they eat; going out and eating in restaurants who salt the food even if you request that they don't). When I control my food preparation and use either no salt or low salt seasoning, my bp is fine.  If I get adequate water that is important.

I am trying to take my medication on time, do not drink any alcoholic beverages and cook with salt or with very low salt seasonings. I do some walking. 

I do have some numbness in my hands when I sleep on them-but I will pay attention to if it happens when I am not sleeping or lying on them.

14,5 to less than 10 years,65-74,"I have been taking Toprol XL for about 5 years. When they came out with the generic last year I was switched to the generic Metroprol. This medication was prescribed for high blood pressure. It has no effect on the blood pressure, but does slow the heart rate down and make the heart beat with less force. It seems the side effects increased with the change to Metoprolol. I also take an ACE inhibitor and an Alpha  blocker, Terazosin. The Alpha blocker is the only medication that has lowered the pressure much at all, but still too high and the effect only lasts for 3-4 hours. I have Diastolic Heart Failure and Arteriosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) with some Atheriosclerosis. These 2 conditions lead to a reduced blood flow rate. All of the traditional antihypertensive medications make the flow rate even lower and are mostly ineffective in reducing the blood pressure. The internal organs sense the reduced flow rate as a reduction in oxygen in the blood stream and do everything they can to raise the flow rate, which usually exceeds the effect of the medication and the blood pressure goes back up. So those of you that have unsatisfactory pressure reduction and side effects from your medications, look at the symptoms of low blood pressure and you will find they match your side effects. You probably have diastolic dysfunction, your heart does not allow enough blood into the chambers to be pumped out. Good luck convincing your doctor to even consider this possibility, it goes against what they were taught in Med School. Also there are no procedures for this or medications. Exercise, weight deduction, limiting salt intake help lower pressure, but do little to increase the flow rate.",High Blood Pressure,Toprol XL oral,4,2,Male,",       ",2,Lee,Patient

30,1 to less than 2 years,35-44,"I was diagnosed with high BP a year ago which was a complete surprise since I've always been very thin, healthy and reasonably active& only 38.  I started taking generic metoprolol by Sandoz- and at first felt really good- it lowered my BP, plus completely eliminated headaches, chestpain& tightness.  However, after 2 months I became extremely exhausted, I began having episodes of numbness& tingling in arms and legs at night and suddenly gained 10 pounds all around the middle. By month 10, I was waking up several times a night with my arms and legs heavy and numb.  Finally I requested the Brand Name TOPROL XL. I've been taking it for 2 months and feel MUCH better.  My energy is back, the numbness&tingling has decreased significantly, and hopefully now I will also start to get rid of that weight around the middle!  It is my personal theory that perhaps the generic metoprolol released the dose too quickly, dropping my BP so much at night that my arms&legs ""fell asleep"" due to lack of circulation- sometimes my AM BP was 85/55. Then I'm thinking maybe my body released a bunch of cortisol to raise my BP again- which contributed to my weight gain around the middle.  My doctor disagrees and suggested I see a neurologist.

Recently I started having symptoms that I attributed to cold symptoms. I have been very sleepy- not tired- sleepy. I would pass out on my sofa after work, and then fall asleep on the sofa again at 8 PM until it was time to get up and go to bed. I would even close my eyes while I took my daily walk because I was so sleepy. I also had dyspnea at the slightest exertion. I also had severe sacral pain and muscle pain in my thighs. I don't take any statin medication, so I couldn't understand why I was having so much musculoskeletal pain.
I decreased my dosage to 50 mg daiily and experienced immediate relief. My dyspnea is better, I feel more alert, and my sacral pain is gone.

14,1 to less than 2 years,45-54,"Sorry to hear so many are having problems but to me this drug is great. I started having severe panic attacks about 25 years ago when my son was born and I decided to stop drinking and doing drugs cold turkey. After stopping the things that were keeping me sedated the panic attacks came on full force.

My Dr back then prescribed me Xanax and it helped some but after about a year it stopped because my body had become used to it so instead of raising the dosage I again just stopped taking it. I decided to battle these panic attacks on my own with no drugs.

About a year ago I went for a check up (first one in 20 years)and they got a BP reading of 191 / 99 not once but 4 times. I went to my Dr and he gave me Toprol 25MG and 
Ativan 1MG. He told me to take 1/2 of a Toprol in the morning and take the Ativan 3 times a day.

I can say I have had no side effects at all and after 3 months he dropped the Ativan to .5MG twice a day and the Toprol to 1/2 a pill every other day. My BP for the last 8 months has been 130/84 at its highest and 118/75 at its lowest with a resting heart rate between 59 and 65. I have not had any panic attacks for the last year and actually feel great.

I do smoke and drink about a gallon or more of Tea daily but even with the caffeine and nicotine in my system those pills keep my BP down. I also admit I am a junk food lover and have been known to eat pizza. burgers and hot dogs 7 days a week but no weight gain so its all good.

I hope you people with side effects find a cure because getting everything under control and back to normal feels great and Toprol + Ativan do the trick for me.

I developed severe panic attacks and depression and was afraid to be alone even for short periods of time. My blood pressure was also running high like 140 or 150 / 90's to 100's. They started me out on Diltiazem which did me absolutely NO good and caused me to feel very tired and sleepy all the time! Then they tried me on bystolic which i had an allergic reaction to and thought my throat was going to completely close up! Then they put me on Metaprolol 50mg tablets once in the morning. I have been on this pill since October. So far the ONLY side effect that I have is that my ankes are swelling pretty bad. It has dropped my blood pressure to like 117/60 or 70 and has dropped my pulse rate to like 70-80. It has also made my heart palpitations very few and far in between! I have NOTHING bad to say about this drug except that is has made my feet swell but I can deal with that verses living every day being petrified that something is gonna happen to me! I am supposed to go to my family dr. to probably get put on a low dose water pill for the swelling! This drug has REALLY helped me!

My cholestrol went through the roof as did my triglycerides--all bec. of the Metformin & diabetes.  We've now added Tricor and Pravastatin to control these two new conditions which helped.

I think it was the lying down & inversion. Now I've been home Norvasc doesn't work. My bp avg is 150/98.I think we need to find out what's causing the spike from basement to penthouse.

34,less than 1 month,55-64,"Since college (30 years ago) my BP would go high (190/110) but I could always make it go down (130/80) by relaxing and deep breathing. About a month ago it started going up and would not come down. I was at the dentist and he refused to work on my tooth until the BP was down. I became worried and went to the DR. My DR. started me on enalapril 50mg/day for 2 weeks. This stabilized my BP at 145/93. My Dr. was not satisfied with the result and started me on HCZ 25mg along with the enalapril. The very first day was spent in bed asleep. I thought it was some kind of sedative. After several days of fighting the tiredness I came back alive. After a month of HCZ I still feel like I just ran the Boston marathon all the time. Periodically I will get a wasted day where I have to nap the day away. I don't experience most of the side affects listed by other reviewers, I'm stable on my feet, think clearly, no swelling or rashes, and have good mental energy. I've not had a problem with urination or constipation. I take the HCZ dose in the AM and by afternoon my stomach feels a bit queasy so I eat to settle it. This routine has developed into eating all the time in order to keep my stomach from being empty. Needless to say I'm gaining weight. I also experience an odd feeling of being slightly high from time to time...maybe this is the lightheadedness described by others. I've noticed if I sit in a chair for more than 5 minutes without talking, writing, or driving I will doze off. There's been some embarrasing moments over this affect. Oddly enough I have experience trouble sleeping at night. The last and worst side affect from the HCZ is loss of libido. My BP is now consistently at  110-120/78-82, but my pulse is always over 100, something I never had a problem with before HCZ.

I thought it was that so I started taking the Prozac at night and the HTC after lunch. However, even with the switch I am still having trouble staying awake at work and when I get home, I usually sleep for a couple hours, get up, have dinner & go back to bed.

My advice is get a new Dr. before this one kills you with over medication! Lisinopril is the culprit for your coughing as told to me by a pharmacist. Please, for your own good, get a second opinion. 
After coughing my head off due to Lisinopril I changed to Amlopidine 5mg. two years ago. Fortunately, no side effects and bp in normal range most of the time. I research all drugs that my new doctor prescribes and so far most of them have too many side effects to even consider taking them. It's still my body and ultimately, I'm the only one responsible for its condition. 
Why do drug salesmen give free samples to doctors? Think about it.

Since I didn't have any of these problems before,.. like I said I attributed it to aging. What brought this medication to my attention?.. I ran out and needed a new prescription, using a military mail order firm, new scripts take 10-14 days to fill... after about 5 days without it I noticed that I had dropped 1 1/2 lbs and now a week later I have lost 7 lbs.. I had gained about 40 lbs over the past 5 years and was miserable, tried exercising, diet etc.with no results or non lasting weight loss.I received my refill yesterday and I think that I am not going to take it and see just what happens. The pain in my shoulder is easing up, no more hip and back pain, (I have had both hip joint replaced, but the muscles around them hurt),the night sweats in the neck/upper chest area have diminished, my dreams have some sequence,no pain in my legs, still waiting for the libido to come back(yes there is sex after 70:-), Still get up during the night to tinkle.. hopefully that will ease up too.

My pressure came down quickly BUT the side effects have been troublesome. Fatigue (especially in the afternoon), weakness, dizziness, hair loss (about 3 times the normal amount of hair in my shower-yikes!), loss of appetite, weirdly cold fingers at times, slight ankle swelling, and low blood pressure. I almost blacked out while driving when I took a deep breath and held it to get rid of a bout of hiccups!
 
I have recently scaled back on my dosages to 5mg of each BP medication daily and my blood pressure so far has been fine with the lower doses. My side effects are much less with the lower doses and I am feeling almost normal. 
I am taking 1200mg garlic daily since I have read it can help lower blood pressure. I am wearing compression stockings during the day to help keep ankle swelling down. I have lost almost 10 lbs since beginning treatment for my BP, I suspect because the meds have killed my appetite.

I had swelling of legs and feet and joint pain for months which I mistook as a result of injury from a fall on ice. Starting this year another Dr. switched me to Losartan 100mg. I also had occasional dry cough all along so to see if made any difference he switched me a few months ago to Lisinopril 40mg and cough got worse! Switched back to Losartan as pharmacist says it is next gen drug better than Lisinopril. Ok so cough almost gone, but leg and ankle swelling and chronic pain remains. Actively changed diet and increased excercised, lost some weight and BP became normal, so 2 weeks ago Dr. agreed to cut back Amlo to 5mg and drop it if BP remains normal. Swelling and pain is reduced so planning to stop Amlo next week.

36,1 to 6 months,45-54,"I can say that BYSTOLIC is one of the best beta blockers currently available.  I have tried several beta blockers (including TOPROL XL). BYSTOLIC is excellent for heart rate control and is also much gentler on the gastro system in comparison to other beta blockers. BYSTOLIC does not have the negative effects on mental functioning such as forgetfullness, mood changes and weird/vivid dreams. It also will improve sexual functioning over time. You need to give this pill time to perform it's magic as your body adjusts. The main side effect's I've had are feeling tired, slight weight increase and occasional joint pains. Keep in mind that every pill has side effects. This is a true all in one pill. It provides vasodilation, works on the Angiotensin sytem, increases nitric oxide, relaxes the heart rate, has blood platelet effects, and controls blood pressure. You do not need to take other HBP medications if your blood pressure is controlled. A problem with this pill is the standard 5mg tablet which is very inconvenient to split in half because it has no score line and is triangular shape. The manufacturer believes that with the 5mg tablet, one size fits all, and everyone should be prescribed 5mg. I disagree, I'm doing fine on 2.5 mg (so far). I can always work my way upward. You will be hard pressed to find a better beta blocker on the market. TOPROL is the second best choice and the gold standard of beta blockers. It is effective, and well researched with a proven record for hypertension, heart failure, MI and arrythmia. It is also known throughout the world.  KERLONE/BETAXOLOL is my second best choice, but the manufacturer has had a recall due to generic screw-ups etc. KERLONE is exactly like TOPROL but with less side effects such as weird dreams and fatigue.

Some of that has subsided in the past month because of a reduced stress level, but notice that the condition returns under certain stress conditions.

68,6 months to less than 1 year,45-54,"I’ve had experiences with quite a few beta blockers over the past few years. All the Bystolic hype about being third generation etc. is rubbish. It provides vasodilation and is beta1 specific, so are many other beta blockers. (If you read the sites Prescribing information for this medication it causes Leydig Cell and SPERM cell damage.)The least side effect claims are all marketing ploys. This pill known as Nebivolol (BYSTOLIC)has been around in Europe since the early 1990’s. The same time period as TOPROL, ZEBETA and KERLONE. It is not that new and drug companies shouldn’t exagerate or twist the facts. I can say that Bystolic definitely has it’s share of side effects, including water retention, sexual dysfunction, forgetfullnes, increases in Cholesterol and Glucose levels and worst of all, Increased Liver enzymes. The best and safest choice for a beta blocker which I have been currently taking is KERLONE, known as BETAXOLOL. Compared to other beta blockers it is pretty remarkable, though not advertised or very popular. Best of all no sexual side effects, less joint pain, and better sleep patterns.

39,less than 1 month,55-64,"Bystolic 5 mg, (one does only thus far) lowered my bp and pulse greatly. However, I cannot function. Took the first does on 6/18/09 at 6:30 p.m. It is now 6/20/09 at 12:30 pm, and am still feeling dizzy, slightly blurring vision and cannot function well. I have been on many, many bp meds throughout the time since being diagnosed with high bp. ALL meds have given me severe and persistent negative side effects - difficulty breathing, significant hair loss, swollen and paralized tongue/throat areas (couldn't move my tongue/throat to swollow, then when I told the doc, he doubled my dose. No, I didn't go for that); joint pain, horrible thoughts, arm/fingers doing to sleep to the point I couldn't turn off my alarm clock; constipation, very dry cough throughout the day and night, fatique with some meds and fatigue because the cough would keep me up all night; and many, many more symptoms. I just want to say to all of you taking these bp meds, that if you are feeling a symptom, you most likely are. You know your body, trust your judgment. When I first experienced the hair loss, the doc said, ""It's not from the medication...it's menopause..."" Well, I stopped taking the med and went on a different one. The hair loss stopped! Prior to taking the Bystolic, I was on a regimen of 30 mg Procardia, XL, and 12.5 mg(doc said to take 25 mg - I cut the dose knowing the difficulties I have). It seems to be working ok. However, prior to the Procardia, 30 mg XL, I was on the 60 mg XL. 60 mg was too strong. It did lower my bp but pulse was usually higher than what I would like. Throughout the last 3 years or so, I have been experiencing ""unexplained waves of anxiety (they stopped as quickly as they would come on), faint-like episodes, palpitations, arrested breathing, and 3 trips to the ER. My doc who prescribed the Procardia, suggested I stop taking Protonix (acid reflux caused by bp meds). I stopped such and for now, no waves of anxiety, no difficulty breathing. Trust your gut!

I had a tightness in my chest that felt like a python was squeezing me to death.  I was short of breath during conversations on the phone.I also had rectal bleeding with the bowel movements.  This all started at the 10'th month or so.  The dr said its all in my head and I demanded to get off it.  He told me to take 5 mg for one week and then 2.5 for another week.  After the third pill of 2.5 I felt like I was going to die and he was on vacation and nobody in the office would see me but a pa.  I went to another dr and he said I would NOT have given you that drug but now that you were on it, we have to work around it.  He put me back on 5 mg for a month and 2.5 for a month and put me on norvasc 5 mg during that weaning time.  Now I am off Bystolic and have the Norvasc at 10 mg.  I feel MUCH better. DO NOT TAKE BYSTOLIC UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. Beta blockers are very dangerous from what I have learned and the gold standard is TOPROL or LOPRESSOR if you need a beta blocker.  The Bystolic is a fraud and I urge you NOT to take it unless you want to come to deaths door.",High Blood Pressure,Bystolic oral,1,1,Male,",       ",1,tryingtostayalive,Patient

15,1 to less than 2 years,45-54,"Sonia - The manufacturer of this drug is Forest Pharmaceutical. 
Note: In regard to your insurance not covering this drug, have your doctor write a letter stating that you cannot tolerate the other beta blockers you were taking in the past, and you had a bad allergic reaction with several others. The company has no choice, unless they go against the doctors orders and risk a law suit. I agree, Bystolic is an excellent beta blocker and energy levels are definitely increased, compared to some other beta blockers. It is also excellent for inflammatory problems, such as high CRP levels, arthritis and stomach issues. I beleive Bystolic helped my colitis. I've had almost no symptoms in over 1 year. Sexual function has also improved in many ways, versus other medications I was taking. Good luck with the Insurance company.  ",High Blood Pressure,Bystolic oral,5,5,Male,",       ",5,PhilG,Patient

28,1 to less than 2 years,45-54,"As mentioned in the post below by ""Kiki"" and others. Bystolic does not appear to be a pill for long term use. All research trials lasted less than 6 months, most were 3 months. It seems 75% of the side effects kick in after about 6 months. The worse side effect with this medication after almost 1 year of use were my limbs falling asleep, even when walking. Hands also constantly fell asleep and loose stools became almost a daily problem. This made me realize the importance and benefit of taking a proven and reliable medication (like Toprol/Atenolol)which some patients have been taking for close to 30 years at very high doses, with great effectiveness and no toxicity. If no one's been taking this pill for more than 3 years, we don't really know if this pill with last the test of time. The 'SENIORS"" trial which was the largest Bystolic clinical trial for heart failure, did not show good results after 1 year of patient use. Toprol and Coreg results were great. Thats why Toprol and Coreg are approved for Heart failure and MI. 2 weeks ago the FDA refused to approve Bystolic for heart failure, because the results were far from the Toprol/Coreg results.

61,1 to less than 2 years,55-64,"I began taking Bystolic shortly after its FDA approval. It was touted in ads by Forest Labs, the manufacturer, as being ""novel"" and a ""new generation beta blocker""-implying that the side effects typical of the beta blocker class of drugs would be less pronounced with Bystolic.I had been having side effects with the beta blocker,ToprolXL so I asked my doc if I could try it. A drug rep had apparently gotten to him already as my doc assured me that the Bystolic would be much better tolerated. He wrote me a new script for it. I have been on the drug now for almost two years. At first it worked rather well but as another reviewer has posted, I feel it might have the potential to become ""toxic"" after awhile. Side effects have slowly grown to include severe insomnia, occasional shortness of breath, depression, weight gain and recently and most annoying of all, tinnitus...a humming sound in my ears. Most troubling is that along with all these adverse side effects Bystolic also seems to lose its effectiveness as an anti-hypertensive after awhile. After about two years my blood pressure began to fluctuate, whereas initially Bystolic controlled it reasonably well. I switched back to Toprol XL and my blood pressure stabilized within a few days. Some of the side effects are easing. Unfortunately, the Toprol also has similar nasty side effects, but at least it does what it's supposed to do. I will also mention that the company that manufactures Bystolic was reprimanded and warned by the FDA back in August 28, 2008 for what the FDA considered misleading advertising. The language of their ads implied that Bystolic had a more tolerable side effect profile; however the FDA ordered them to cease making such claims. Like many of you I am SO fed up with the nasty side effects of the drugs available for those of us with hypertension. I also wish physicians would stop their tendency to dismiss our reports of adverse drug side effects.

However, could not get rid of the pain in my back, particularly first thing in the morning. Essentially had to crawl out of bed and take a few hours walking around until back pain subsided. Did not want to take another medication in order to alleviate back pain. Fatigue was still a big problem. Fatigue had subsided somewhat, but still a major concern. I have tried to be proactive regarding the back pain. To that end went to urologists to check prostrate. Enlarged prostrate etc, can cause similar symptoms. Prostrate was fine no problems there so can eliminate prostrate but still suspect Bystolic. I now, during a scheduled physical, will have a kidney work up etc to make sure nothing is going on. In a way I am disappointed to have to come off of Bystolic. Drug is really effective for BP control and I had hoped to come off of Norvasc and HCTZ and just have to use Bystolic.

1,1 to less than 2 years,45-54,This is my second time on Bystolic. The second time around I went from 2.5 mg to 5.0 mg.  The doubling of dose was due to my increased hypertension. At 5.0 I noticed a dramatic increase in extreme tiredness and dizziness.  I lost motivation to get my daily chores done.  The increase in dose really did not help decrease my high blood pressure either!  I gained 5 pounds right away and have been unable to drop any weight even with extended water fasts of 3 days.  I did more research on other natural paths of controlling my BP and discovered the miracles of Magnesium.  After just 3 days my BP went from 140-150 (systolic) to now 120-135.  Diastolic numbers greatly improved too.  I halved my bystolic down to 2.5 and have maintained 120/80 range.  My goal is to increase my stores of magnesium with time and hopefully kick the bystolic.  Bystolic does help with mood swings (menapause) and anxiety to some extent. Overall my low dose is tolerable.  Some headaches and heavy legs due to water retention has also been experienced.

As we get older, our bodies suffer more and more irreparable damage from the environment.  You need to find out what is causing your BP to go up and fix it--not gloss over and chemically medicate it.  The American Heart Association is lying on it's website when they claim ""no one knows why a person has high blood pressure."" There are tons of studies out there on natural substances and fixing your diet (no sugar, low carb)to lower your BP, the better your blood sugar is, the better your blood pressure will be, in general.

After taking Atenolol (10mg) daily for approximately three years the side affects started.
I was unable to function at all three or four days a week.
The doctors where unable to determined what was causing my severe dizziness and lightheadedness.
This was after numerous X-Rays, Cat Scans and MRI’s
After almost two years of suffering, I decided to quit all of my Vitamins and supplemental; I take about twenty a day.
As a last resort I found another Doctor and had him find another blood pressure medication.
I’m now taking Amlodipine (10mg) daily.
It seems to be working somewhat, my BP is still much high.
After coming off the Atenolol over a thirty day period about 80% of the side affects are gone, thank the Lord for small favors.
Be very careful with all of the so called FDA approved blood pressure drugs.

I would recommend that if you are on this drug and have had any of the symptoms in mine or other post talk to your doctor. Don't let them tell you to just take more and the symptoms will go away (chances are they will just get worse). Don't let them change you to another beta blocker as well.

The whole time I was on this medicine I went between my PCP, an ENT Specialist with Reflux problems, as well as a trip to the ER when the Esophageal Spasms got very bad one night and I thought I was having a heart attack. The ER actually increased my dosage of Atenolol! None of the doctors I saw ever realized the problem I was having was a side effect of Atenolol. I finally stopped taking this medicine on my own after doing a lot of research and reading that the problems I was having with Reflux ""could be"" a side effect of it. A few weeks after being off of it my Reflux started to improve and the Esophageal Spasms went away entirely. I know this medicine was the cause, because a week ago my heart started racing again and my BP was elevated, so I gave in and tried to go back on the Atenolol. After only 2 doses I had painful Esophageal Spasms again. I will be scheduling a follow up with my doctor ASAP to see what else I might try to take in place of the Atenolol.

35,10 years or more,75 or over,"This is a beta blocker.  Beta blockers should be the second drug you take for hypertension.  First should be a thiazide diuretic because  it has fewer side effects.  These two drug classes are the only drugs for hypertension that by themselves reduce the risk of heart attack or death.   Together, they reduce the risk of death or heart attack more than either does alone.  Once you take minimal amounts of these two drugs, if more is needed, add an  ACE inhibitor which further reduces the risk of death/heart attack.  Caution:  alone, ACE inhibitor does not reduce the risk.  And then consider adding a fourth drug, a calcium channel blocker  which, in combination with the others,  adds further protection against death/heart attack.

My dr prescrbd Atenolol & w/in 2 days, my right foot was lightly puffy & tingling. It was sore from a few days b4, so I did not make the connection. Until Day3 when both legs - knees to toes - looked worse than being 9 mo pregnant. Painfully numb...pins & needle sensations. Clothes could not get past my ankles, forget any shoes besides flip flops. In dresses or skirts,my ankles looked like a 6 pack of hot dogs. Skin taute n shiny, waddling, unable to breathe. I was told this was an 'Uncommon' side effect, stop taking asap, and go to the ER or Walk In ER clinic since it was the weekend. I was gasping for air-unable to get a good breath. Brutal. Kidney pain. I went to the ER and was diagnosed w/ Bilateral Lower Extremity Edema. Its been 9 days and everything has gone back down except my feet which waiver from worsening to improving. The Dr said my feet will be the last areas to heal 100% being they are the farthest, distance wise, away and absorbtion is needed. I noticed they significantly reduce in swelling when they are wrapped or in a sneaker, which barely fits over my foot. Elevating and icing doesnt do much quick enough. The DR even said that this med usually isn't a first choice for a primary. One w/ a diuretic is standard, if your blood panel works within those parameters.

While taking regular Xanax (which is addictive, but I have peace in my life again), I didn't gain any additional weight. I started reflecting on my time gardening today.

3 days later I developed allergy symptoms; congestion,very runny nose and loss of hearing. Went to Dr. took cipro 10 days; no help; saw reports so cut med in half and seemed better; hearing better; May 27 developed severe sinus infection (never before had one) took Z-Pak 10 days; added 2 more antibiodics and hearing is still getting worse.  Beware of ototoxic drugs - ask Drs.  Am seeing Dr. in 2 days and have an appt. to ear/nose/throat spec. next week.
Hearing loss may be irreversible.  It did help my blood pressure, but so did my prev. one. Worse part is you have these problems and impossible to see Dr. - and they dont always listen. Should have seen spec. earlier, but as one Dr. said ""you just need a hearing aid""  I told my new 
Dr. that I will not take lisinopril again.
Does anyone else notice hearing loss - I am very hard of hearing and can't hear phone ring and I was the one who ""heard"" a pin drop til this started.  Be careful of drugs!  I only found out about the side effects on this site - thank you!

The cough started out light & after some years it got so bad I was bring up flem from my lungs & I also started having joint pains all over my body that I am starting to believe was caused by it.I say if you take it & start to have a slight cough or any other symptom STOP USING IT  PLEASE.
COZARR has brought my blood pressure down to the normal range for the first time in almost ten years  116 TO 118 over  68  which is impressive for me because the lisinopril was never able to get my pressure below 130 over 80.  STAY AWAY FROM  LISINOPRIL.  your doctor will leave you on any meds you will continue to take unless you insist that they give you something that is better for you . they will tell you a little cough is normal.

Azor effective, softer tinnitus, but zone-out in evening, bad sinus/ear infections, testosterone low, PSA up, some hair loss.  Diovan worse than lisinopril.

11,less than 1 month,25-34,"I was given this medications for high blood pressure and took it for 2 weeks. I began to have intense cravings for salt and spicy food. I also severe from depression and take an antidepressant for it. Over the two weeks I was on the medication, I became more and more depressed. It got to the point where I couldn't control my emotions. My tears were unstoppable. My doctor told me to stop taking the medication nd he switched me to a calcium channel blocker and increased my antidepressant. I researched more the connection between diuretics, salt cravings, and depression and discovered the diuretic in Lisinopril was ridding my body of salt; hence, my intense salt craving. I also discovered that salt is considered the body's natural anti-depressant which explains my deterioration in mood. Also, discovered that intense salt cravings means that you are probably deficient in sodium and low blood sodium levels can be fatal so if you have intense salt cravings you should give your body what it wants and have your blood sodium levels checked. I would not recommend this medication to any that suffers from depression. I went completely haywire and couldn't make through any day at work this week. I am starting to feel better. I am excited about the Calcium channel blocker because it helps prevent chest pain which has been my major complaint. My blood pressure hovers a little over 140/90 with the 2nd number being the highest. I didn't notice significant drops in blood pressure with Lisinopril which could be because of the extra salt I was adding. I did notice some weight loss while on lisinopril that made me happy. I will miss the weight loss but it is not worth running around like a crazy salt addict crying uncontrobly. Depression isn't a recognized side effect of Lisinopril but it should be.

An ACE inhibitor (or angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor) is a pharmaceutical drug used primarily for the treatment of hypertension (high blood pressure) and congestive heart failure.

Originally synthesized from compounds found in pit viper venom, ACE inhibitors inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme (a component of the blood pressure-regulating renin-angiotensin system), thereby decreasing the tension of blood vessels and blood volume, thus lowering blood pressure.

Frequently prescribed ACE inhibitors include captopril, enalapril, lisinopril, and ramipril

After about 2 months I stoped taking the drug and a few days later my legs stoped hurting. My husband took this drug for a couple of years and almost cried his legs hurt so bad. We never knew the drug had this side effects untill after he died. I figured out what was causing my legs to hurt after I started taking this medcine. A friend of mine told me her legs had hurt for year or two and I told her my experience with this medcine she ask the doctor to take her off of it. He did and her legs got 95 percent better. This medcine will cause a big knot behind the knee also. This should be listed on the side effects but it is not. Doctors sometime will not beleive a person when they tell them about this medcine causing the legs to hurt. So far 3-4 people that I know of has proved it. Watch out for this side effect. You will hurt really bad in your legs.

I had no idea that it was a side effect of the 10 mg of lisinopril that I took daily.  My doctor took me off this drug following a thyroidectomy last month.  The cough continued, except when I was in the hospital and a few days of convalescence at home. I couldn't figure out why I was cough-free for those few days until I needed to resume taking the prescribed pain reliever. I realized that the Tramadol HCL stopped the cough! I was stunned! This pain reliever is non-narcotic and non-addictive and easy on the stomach.   My doctor ordered a refill so that I could continue taking it for this horrendous cough.  I only need to take one pill in the morning and one at night, and I'm good to go.  On my next visit with him I will ask about the long-term effects of taking this drug as a cough suppressant.  Hopefully, this cough won't preempt my life indefinitely, but in the meantime I give thanks that I had that surgery when I did, and found some relief.

I quit alcohol, nicotine, and caffeine all in one movement after that ER incident. Two more times in the ER realized I had a ""hot tooth"" that could not be touched by any type of painkiller due to the massive inflammation. Timeline is critical here now.

Went to my new PCP on day number 10 and he wanted to put me on 20mg Lisinopril-HTCZ (the one that makes you go pee in 30 mins after you take it).

Also switched to a low sodium diet, and stopped eating out. Started exercising (walking) 1 mile or more a day. Began noticing the numbers starting to creep back up and also having extreme cramps in my calves and thighs while walking. I let my PCP know and he switched to the non-HCTZ Lisinopril 20mg.

I believe it has been slowly poisoning me. Itchy skin and strange hives that I thought were spider bites, swollen watery eyes, a sun burned feeling under skin, electrolyte problems, cramping in legs, feet and hands, headaches and extreme exhaustion. today was my last dose. Never again.  I will go natural and cut out all sugar, gluten, walk, yoga and breathing exercises.  I am very upset with myself that I stayed on this awful drug for so long. It only gave me an excuse to not try harder and it was debilitating. I believe I was on the verge of a life threatening allergic reaction.  Oh and of course I had the Lisinopril cough like so many.  It is sad that we end up in desperate situations and have to go this route sometimes, but I believe this drug is ONLY  meant for a short term in order to buy time in getting the weight off or eating better, more exercise etc. Otherwise it will eventually cause terrible damage.
